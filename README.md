# Overview 

This project is a web scroller built using Python and Selenium. The primary purpose of this is to automate the scrolling of web pages to facilitate data extraction or to simply navigate through content without manual intervention. This can be particularly useful for scraping data from websites that load content dynamically as you scroll.

# Features
